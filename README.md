# Time Tracker
### About
This is a time tracker much like work. Create a project, start and label a timer, end the timer and save to disk, then view time spent on the project. That's all this does.

This project came about since I found myself too focused during programming sessions to the point where I would neglect proper time management and skip meals or not have enough time to do things I already mentally planned on doing. I use this daily to track overall time spent on various tasks whenever I am at my computer.

First and foremost this is a hobby project meant to assist me; far from a polished product meant for other users. If you are reading this, attempts have been made to allow to allow intuitive usage for you, but I have not spent much time developing the interface and explaining all that you may need to know or any side effects that may arise.

Secondly, this is a test bed to allow me to practice my software design skills and test new facets of C++ and programming in general on a larger project than a hello-world program. If you have any tips or questions, please inform me. I am always open to learn.
